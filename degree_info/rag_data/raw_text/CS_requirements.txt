The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree program provides a strong technical background for students planning to begin careers upon graduation and for those interested in graduate study in computer science. This program allows students to take more coursework in computer science and related technical areas than does the bachelor of science and arts degree program.

In addition to the three options leading to the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, students may apply to the Integrated Program, which leads to simultaneous completion of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and the Master of Science in Computer Science, the Master of Science in Information Studies, or the Master of Science in Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics. The requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Integrated Program are given below. The requirements for the Master of Science in Computer Science, the Master of Science in Information Studies, and the Master of Science in Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics are described in the Graduate Catalog.

Students who would like to pursue any of the following degree programs must first be admitted. The admission processes for Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Turing Scholars Honors, Integrated Program and Computer Science and Business Honors are described in The Major in Computer Science; the admission process for Computer Science Honors is described in the section Dean’s Scholars Honors Program.

Additional Requirements for Honors Computer Science and Business
Admission
Admission to Honors Computer Science and Business (CSB) is limited to a small number of high preforming students who are chosen on a competitive basis. Students selected for the program will have demonstrated exceptional potential for success in both computer science and business. Admission decisions are made by the CSB Committee. Students enter the program as freshmen.

Students entering the University as freshmen may apply to the CSB by completing a separate online application available through the Office of Admissions. The CSB Committee considers the student's SAT Reasoning Test or ACT scores, high school class rank, preparatory courses, extracurricular activities, evidence of leadership ability, and other objective criteria.

Academic Standards
A student who enters CSB as a freshman must have a grade point average of at least 3.25 on the courses taken in residence during the fall and spring semesters of the first year to continue in the program. The student must complete at least 12 semester hours in residence on the letter-grade basis during each of those two semesters. After the freshman year, each student is dismissed from the program if their overall, computer science, or business grade point average drops below 3.25. In addition to this grade point average requirement, students must know and abide by the academic and disciplinary policies given in this catalog and in the General Information Catalog. Those who fail to do so will be considered for academic dismissal from the program. Under special circumstances and at the discretion of the CSB Program Committee, a student will be allowed to continue in the program under academic review. Students in scholastic difficulty should discuss their problems with the CSB Honor Program director(s) and their academic advisor(s).

Graduation
To graduate under the CSB Honors Program, the student must earn a University grade point average of at least 3.25 and a grade point average of at least 3.25 in business courses and a grade point average of at least 3.25 in computer science courses. A candidate for any degree must be enrolled at The University of Texas at Austin in the semester in which the degree is awarded.

Students in CSB must satisfy the University's Core Curriculum and degree requirements for a B.S. in Computer Science and for a B.B.A.; combined degree requirements below. If students later elect to complete only one degree, they must consult their academic advisor(s) and fulfill all degree requirements.
